# Project Companion Documentation

This project follows a structured companion guide to document the build process from scratch.

## Core Locations

- **Companion Root**: `companion/` - Contains the overall roadmap and step-by-step guides.
- **Main Roadmap**: `companion/README.md` - Details each step and task in the build process.
- **First Step**: `companion/STEP_0/TASK_0/README.md` - Outlines the initial tasks to accomplish.

## Directory Structure

The documentation is organized into steps and tasks:
- `companion/STEP_N/` represents a major phase of the project.
- `companion/STEP_N/TASK_M/` represents a specific actionable task within that phase.
